YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW? NO MORE SUCH EXCUSES

0. Install Trac

On Mac OS X this is as easy as:

 # easy_install Trac

1. Create a test Trac install somewhere:

 $ trac-admin <trac-name> initenv

The default offered values are good.

This will create a <trac-name> directory with the Trac install in the
current directory.

2. Create a local SVN repo:

 $ svnadmin create <repo-name>

3. Checkout the repo and add a dummy file:

 $ svn co file://<full-path-to-svn-repo> # including leading slash, e.g. file:///home/username/svn-repo/

4. Add the repo in the trac.ini:

 $ $EDITOR <trac-name>/conf/trac.ini

Change:

repository_dir = <full-path-to-svn-repo>
repository_type = svn

5. Create htpasswd file for Trac auth:

 $ htpasswd -c <auth-file-name> <desired-username>

Remember the file location.

6. Add yourself as admin:
 
 $ $ trac-admin <trac-name> permission add <username> TRAC_ADMIN

6. Run trac server:

 $ tracd -s -r --port 8000 --basic-auth='<trac-name>,<full-path-to-auth-file-name>,<whatever-you-want>' <path-to-trac-folder> # see http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracStandalone

You should now have a working vanilla Trac at http://localhost:8000/, where you can log in and be an admin.

7. Checkout the plugin in R/W mode

 $ git clone git@github.com:Automattic/vip-trac-code-comments.git

8. Deploy the plugin in development mode

 $ python setup.py develop -mxd <path-to-trac>/plugins

9. Go to the Admin section in Trac, then Plugins and enable all the components of the TracCodeComments plugin
